**ITEM Highlight:** Plethora now includes the **.Context** libraries. This allow for a single definition point for common actions, and for these actions to be made available through-out the application in a consistent manner depending on the current "context" of the application.

Both WPF and Winforms are supported.

**Project Description**

Plethora is fundamentally designed for high-performance applications, and much of the library is dedicated to gaining performance advantages over the regular C# libraries.

Included are:
  - Indexed collections and lookup
  - Helper methods for achieving common tasks
  - Additional LINQ methods
